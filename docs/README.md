# Boreal Design System UI Kit

Welcome to the **Boreal Design System** UI Kit – a collection of reusable, theme‑aware Angular components built on top of Angular Material. This library provides a consistent look and feel across all applications in the ecosystem.

- **Quick start**: Install the package, import the `UiKitModule`, and start using components like `<bds-button>` or `<bds-table>`.
- **Documentation**: See the other docs in this folder for setup, component catalog, theming, contribution guidelines, and FAQs.

> **Note**: This repository follows the Nx monorepo structure. The UI Kit lives under `libs/ui-kit`.
